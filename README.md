# Mini AI Training Model for Object Recognition from Point Clouds

The mini AI training model is used to train AI to recognize and predict objects such as beams, columns, floors, and walls from point cloud files. Then, the model is integrated with a Revit add-in to automate the modeling of these objects in Revit.

## About This Project

This is a small model developed after a few months of research, and I sincerely hope to receive feedback and contributions.

Thank you very much!
